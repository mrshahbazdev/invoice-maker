# Business Profile & Customization

Customize how your business appears to your clients and manage your core configuration settings under **Settings > Business Profile**.

## Company Details
Set your company name, logo, address, and contact information. This information is automatically populated onto your invoices and estimates, ensuring your documents always look professional.

## Brand Colors and Theming
Choose a custom brand color that reflects your company's identity. This color will be dynamically injected into all public links, your client portal, and the PDF invoices you send out. You can also customize your workspace theme, including page backgrounds and card colors, to create a personalized working environment.

## B2B Network Sync (Auto-Expenses)
Opt-in to the "Accept Network Invoices" feature in your profile. If enabled, whenever another business on the platform sends you an invoice, it will automatically appear in your Expenses tab without any manual entry! This powerful feature completely eliminates double-data entry when doing business with other platform users.

## Payment Terms
Define default payment terms (e.g., Net 15, Net 30) for your invoices. These default terms will automatically apply to any new invoice you create, saving you time.

## Automated Payment Reminders
Tired of chasing clients down for money? The platform now does it for you. 
- You can toggle the Automated Payment Reminders feature entirely ON or OFF.
- You can configure the exact interval for reminders (default: every 7 days).
- The system will automatically email a professional reminder, complete with a "Pay Now" link, to clients with overdue unpaid invoices.
