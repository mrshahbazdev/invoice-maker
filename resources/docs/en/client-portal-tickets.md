# The Client Portal & Support System: Complete Overview

Providing your customers with a premium, white-glove experience is what separates modern businesses from outdated competitors. Instead of emailing static PDFs that often get trapped in spam filters, your subscription equips you with a secure, interactive web application designed entirely for your customers.

## 1. Accessing the Client Portal
Security and ease-of-use rarely coexist, but the Client Portal utilizes a modern authentication standard to eliminate friction.

### Passwordless "Magic Link" Authentication
Your clients do not have to create an account on this platform. They do not need to remember a complex password, and they do not need to manage a profile.
- When you dispatch an Invoice or an Estimate from your administrative dashboard, the recipient receives a professionally formatted email.
- Inside that email is a large, secure button containing a cryptographically hashed "Magic Link."
- When the client clicks the button, the system verifies the token in milliseconds and automatically logs them into their dedicated portal directly from their browser, eliminating 100% of the login friction.

## 2. Invoices & Billing Management
Once inside the portal, your client isn't just looking at the single invoice you just sent them. They are looking at their complete financial history with your business.

### The Interactive Statement
- **Lifetime Totals:** They can immediately see the total amount they have paid you historically, alongside the exact dollar amount they currently owe across all outstanding invoices.
- **Invoice Listing:** They can view a table listing every invoice ever sent to them. They can dynamically sort this list by Status (Draft, Sent, Paid, Overdue) or by Issue Date.
- **Dynamic Previews:** Clicking any invoice opens it securely within their browser, formatting perfectly regardless of whether they are on a massive desktop monitor or a small mobile phone.

### Bulk Downloading
Accountants love the Client Portal because of this feature.
- During tax season, your clients may ask you to resend every invoice from the previous year. You do not need to do this manually.
- Advise them to click their Magic Link, check the select-all box on their dashboard, and hit **"Download All."**
- The system automatically packages all their historic PDFs into a single, clean ZIP folder downloaded directly to their computer.

### Instant Online Payments
If you have configured Stripe in your Business Settings, your clients can settle operations instantly.
- An outstanding invoice will feature a prominent **"Pay Now"** button.
- Clicking this opens a secure, integrated Stripe checkout window natively within the portal.
- They enter their credit card information securely. Once processed, the portal updates instantly, and your own administrative dashboard automatically marks that invoice as Paid. No manual reconciliation is required.

## 3. The Interactive Support System
Communication surrounding billing operations can get incredibly messy when buried in email threads or text messages. The Client Portal features an integrated Support Ticket system designed to centralize and track inquiries.

### Client-Side Ticket Creation
- If a client has a question (e.g., "Can you update my shipping address?" or "I have a question about this consulting fee"), they can navigate to the **Support** tab inside their portal and click **"Open New Ticket"**.
- They provide a subject and a message, and submit.
- The ticket is immediately linked permanently to their CRM profile.

### Business-Side Ticket Resolution
- Back in your Administrative Dashboard, you will see a badge appear on the **Support Tickets** tab.
- Click into the ticket to read our client's message.
- You can reply directly from your interface. 
- *The Magic Action:* Our system takes your reply and automatically emails it back to the client. The client can simply reply to that email, and their response gets routed directly back into the ticket thread in the system.
- This ensures 100% of communication regarding this client is permanently archived and attached directly to their billing profile, preventing crucial information from being lost in siloed inboxes.
