# Client Portal & Support Tickets

Offer your customers a premium, interactive experience through the unified Client Portal and Support Ticket suite.

## The Dedicated Client Portal
Instead of just sending static PDF attachments via email, your clients receive a secure, interactive web experience.
- **Magic Links:** Clients receive a secure "Magic Link" to access their portal. They do not need to create an account or remember a password to view their documents.
- **Unified Statement View:** Inside the portal, they are greeted by their complete lifetime statement. They can see every invoice they've ever received, their total payment history, and their currently outstanding balance.
- **Bulk Downloading:** Clients can select multiple invoices at once and download them in a single batch file for their own accounting purposes.
- **Online Payments:** The portal integrates seamlessly with Stripe, allowing clients to click "Pay Now" on any outstanding invoices directly from their dashboard.

## Support Tickets System
Stop losing email threads and centralize customer inquiries right alongside their billing data.
- **Client Side:** Inside the portal, clients can click "Open New Ticket" to ask a question (e.g., "Question about recent bill" or "Address update").
- **Business View:** You can view these incoming tickets inside your own administrative dashboard under the "Client Support" tab.
- **Direct Replies:** Reply directly to the ticket from your dashboard. The client receives an email notification with your reply and can respond directly back into the portal, maintaining a perfect thread of communication linked directly to their CRM profile.
