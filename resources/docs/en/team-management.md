# Team Management & Collaboration

Efficiently manage your staff and collaborate without sharing passwords. Navigate to **Settings > Team** to access these features.

## Inviting New Members
You can invite employees, partners, or accountants to join your workspace.
- Click **"Invite Member"**.
- Enter their email address and assign a role.
- The system will dispatch a secure email invitation. Once they accept, they will create their own password and gain access to your business environment.

## User Roles & Permissions
When inviting a member, you must assign a role to control their access level:
- **Admin:** Has full access to everything, including modifying business settings, themes, and inviting other members.
- **Member / Employee:** Can create invoices, log expenses, and manage clients, but cannot alter core business settings or delete the workspace.

## Seamless Collaboration
All team members operate within the same unified workspace. 
- Invoices created by an employee are immediately visible to the Admin.
- Expenses logged by one user update the shared Cash Book in real-time.
- Any changes made are synchronized, ensuring your team is always working with the most up-to-date financial data.

## Removing Access
If an employee leaves, an Admin can revoke their access instantly from the Team management dashboard, securing your company's data immediately while preserving all the documents they created.
