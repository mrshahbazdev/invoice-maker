# Team Management & Collaboration: Comprehensive Guide

Scaling your operations effectively requires bringing your employees, partners, and financial advisors onto the platform. The Team Management module allows you to collaborate securely within a single, unified workspace without ever needing to share sensitive passwords.

Navigate to **Settings > Team** to access these features.

## 1. Inviting Members to Your Workspace
You can dynamically scale your workspace by inviting new personnel.

### The Invitation Process
- Click the **"Invite Member"** button located in the top right of the Team dashboard.
- Enter the individual's exact email address.
- Select their assigned **Role** (which determines what they can and cannot see).
- The system will dispatch a highly secure, time-sensitive email invitation to them.

### Acceptance and Onboarding
- When the invitee clicks the link in their email, they will be prompted to create their own secure password.
- Upon logging in, they are immediately placed inside your business workspace automatically. 
- You will be able to see their status change from "Pending" to "Active" inside your Team dashboard.

## 2. Granular User Roles and Restrictions
Data security is paramount. The platform provides distinct roles to ensure employees have the tools they need to work without exposing sensitive core configurations.

### **The Administrator Role**
This is the highest level of access aside from the primary Business Owner.
- **Capabilities:** Admins have unrestricted access to all standard features. They can create, edit, and delete invoices, manage all clients, log core expenses, and view high-level financial reporting.
- **Administrative Privileges:** Admins can alter business settings (such as changing the global taxation rules or the company name), switch the visual Theme of the application, and independently invite or remove other standard Members.

### **The Member (Employee) Role**
This role is tailored for standard staff members, sales representatives, and general operations personnel.
- **Capabilities:** Members can execute day-to-day operations seamlessly. They can create estimates to send to prospects, convert estimates into invoices, manage the real-time product inventory, and handle client communications via support tickets.
- **Restrictions:** Members are completely locked out of the global Settings module. They cannot change your company's banking details, they cannot manipulate your global email templates, and they absolutely cannot delete the workspace or remove other users.

## 3. Real-Time Collaboration Dynamics
Because you are all operating within the exact same database environment, collaboration is absolutely immediate.

- **Instant Synchronicity:** If a sales employee generates an Estimate while standing in front of a client, the Business Administrator back at the office can see that Estimate appear in the dashboard the very second it is saved.
- **Shared Financial Ledger:** Expenses logged by out-of-office contractors immediately populate the unified Cash Book, enabling accountants or admins to constantly view the true current profitability of the business without requesting expense reports.
- **Traceability:** Every document generated is linked to the user who created it, maintaining a clear paper trail of operational responsibility.

## 4. Security and Access Revocation
We understand that personnel changes happen rapidly. Ensuring your financial data remains secure when an employee departs is a one-click process.

- **Instant Revocation:** If an employee leaves your organization, an Administrator can navigate to the Team dashboard and locate their profile. With a single click, you can instantly revoke their access.
- **Session Termination:** Revoking access immediately terminates their active sessions on all devices. If they try to refresh their page, they will be immediately locked out.
- **Preserved History:** Crucially, removing a team member's access *does not* delete the invoices, clients, or expenses they created during their tenure. Your historical financial data and operational paper trail remain perfectly intact.
