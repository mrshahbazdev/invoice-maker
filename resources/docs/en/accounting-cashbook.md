# Accounting & Cashbook: Complete Overview

While generating invoices and logging receipts is important, making sense of all that data is the true purpose of the platform. The **Cash Book** acts as your automated, real-time Chief Financial Officer (CFO), mathematically processing your daily actions into cohesive accounting reports.

Navigate to the **Accounting** or **Cash Book** tab to view your master ledger.

## 1. The Core Profitability Engine (P&L)
You don't need an accounting degree to understand your business's health. The top of the Cash Book provides an instantaneous Profit and Loss (P&L) overview based on absolute reality.

### Real-Time Math
- **Total Revenue (Inflows):** This number is mathematically derived exclusively from actual payments. If you send a $10,000 invoice, your revenue *does not* increase. Your revenue only increases when that invoice is officially marked as "Paid" or "Partial." This provides you with a true Cash-Basis accounting perspective.
- **Total Expenses (Outflows):** This is the aggregate total of every receipt and bill you have logged via the Expenses module.
- **Net Profitability:** The system subtracts Outflows from Inflows to give you your exact, to-the-penny Net Profit.

## 2. Advanced Filtering and Date Ranges
Understanding your lifetime profitability is great, but understanding seasonal trends is how you optimize your business logic.

- **Date Range Filters:** In the top right corner of the Cash Book, you can filter the entire mathematical engine by time. 
- Select "This Month", "Last Quarter", or "This Year."
- Instantly, the Revenue, Expenses, and Net Profit numbers will recalculate to show you only the data relevant to that specific period. You can easily determine if Q3 was more profitable than Q2 with a single click.

## 3. The Master Ledger
Below the high-level metrics is the Master Ledger table. This is the chronological heartbeat of your business.

### Unified Transaction View
Unlike other tabs where Invoices and Expenses are separated, the Master Ledger merges them chronologically.
- A green row indicates an Inflow (a paid invoice arriving).
- A red row indicates an Outflow (an expense being logged).
- You can trace the exact flow of money in and out of your business day-by-day. Clicking on any row will securely link you directly back to the original Invoice or Expense document for deeper auditing.

## 4. Exporting Data for Your Accountant
Come tax season, your accountant will need your financial data. Giving them your login is one option, but the system provides a much better tool.

### Universal CSV Export
Click the **"Export to CSV"** button located on the Cash Book.
- The system will package your entire filtered Master Ledger into a pristine, beautifully formatted Excel spreadsheet (.csv file).
- The spreadsheet includes columns for Dates, Transaction Types, Descriptions, Billed Entities, and exact Amounts.
- You can instantly email this file to your CPA, making your annual tax preparation completely painless and taking just three seconds to complete.
