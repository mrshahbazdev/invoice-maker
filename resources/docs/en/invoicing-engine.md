# The Invoicing Engine

The core of your business. Create stunning, professional invoices in seconds.

## Creating Invoices
Navigate to the **Invoices** tab and click **Create**. Select a client, add products or services from your inventory, and apply custom taxes or discounts. The system handles all the math instantly.

## Automated Recurring Invoices
Automate your entire billing lifecycle directly within the app!
- The "Make Recurring Invoice" toggle is available when creating or editing an invoice.
- Select the billing interval (Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly) and set the exact date for the first run.
- The system automatically replicates the invoice, generates a fresh PDF, and dispatches it to the client with a "Pay Now" link embedded.

## Online Payments (Stripe)
Allow your clients to pay invoices via Credit Card, Apple Pay, and Google Pay through the public invoice link!
- Configure your Stripe API keys securely in your User Profile settings.
- The Public Invoice Viewer automatically displays a bold "Pay with Card" button for unpaid invoices.
- Upon successful payment, the system automatically marks the invoice as Paid and generates an Income entry into your Cash Book.

## PDF Generation & Public Links
Download a pixel-perfect PDF version of the invoice instantly, or share a secure web link with your client. They can view the invoice online, download it, and even leave comments directly on the document.

## Estimates & Quotes
Send proposals before finalizing a sale using the **Estimates** tab.
- Estimates share a similar creation flow to Invoices.
- Once a client approves the estimate via their public link, you can convert it directly into an active Invoice with one single click.

## Custom Invoice Templates
Make your invoices look exactly how you want.
Navigate to the **Templates** tab to use the drag-and-drop Template Builder. Construct new invoice layouts, switching between minimalist designs, standard structures, or dynamic modern layouts.
