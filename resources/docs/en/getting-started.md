# Welcome: Getting Started Guide

Welcome to your all-in-one Financial Operating System. Whether you are a sole proprietor consultant or scaling a mid-sized corporation, this central platform is engineered to radically automate your cash flow, customer relationships, and complex financial analysis so you can focus strictly on growth.

This initial guide provides a highly-structured, 4-step deployment checklist designed to take your operation from a blank slate to sending fully integrated, legally compliant digital invoices and accepting online credit card sweeps in under fifteen minutes.

## Step 1: Establish Your Global Business Configuration
Before sending operations outbound, it is vital to ensure that your corporate identity and legal compliance vectors are properly established in the backend. 

1. Navigate to **Settings** using the primary sidebar sidebar.
2. Select **Business Profile**.
3. **Legal Identifiers:** Enter your registered corporate name, physical headquarters address, and crucially, your local Tax Identification or VAT Number. The engine requires this to generate legally compliant tax documents globally.
4. **Visual Identity:** Upload your corporate high-resolution logo. The system uses advanced rendering to inject this exactly onto your outgoing PDFs and internal portals seamlessly.
5. Save your alterations.

## Step 2: Architecture Your Master Catalog
Instead of manually typing lines of text every time you desire to bill a customer, the system is designed to build invoices mathematically using pre-saved components. We highly recommend configuring your primary inventory or typical service packages first.

1. Navigate to the **Products & Services** tab.
2. Click **Create New Item**.
3. Input your core offering (e.g., "Senior Software Consulting" or "Standard Physical Widget").
4. Attach a Default Unit Price and an inherent Base Tax Rate. By defining this now, you ensure that every invoice moving forward operates on standardized corporate logic instead of manual guesswork.

## Step 3: Populate the CRM and Execute an Invoice
With your data structure established, we are ready to execute your first financial request.

1. Navigate to the **Clients Management** module.
2. Click **Add New Client** and input their explicit contact details. Ensure you place an accurate, active email address in the field, as the engine utilizes this for direct communication and notification relay.
3. Once the client is securely nested in your database, navigate to the **Invoices** tab.
4. Click **Create Invoice**, select the client you just built, and utilize the dropdown menu to instantly inject the Products you built in Step 2 into the pricing matrix.

## Step 4: The Final Polish (Client Delivery)
The visual structure of the document matters heavily. You want a document that reflects the quality of your service.

1. Before finalizing the invoice, scroll to the **Templates** section of the builder. 
2. The platform provides a full suite of beautifully designed structural skins (from Minimalist Text to Bold, Colored tables). Select one that fits your brand.
3. Click **"Save & Send"**. The system executes a highly stylized, templated email containing a direct "Magic Link" allowing the client completely passwordless access to their secure Portal to review the specific invoice.

Your operating system is officially completely active. Proceed to the deeply detailed sub-guides in the Help Center sidebar to begin mastering Advanced Expense Tracking, Bulk Financial Automation, and Stripe Credit Card sweeping integration.
