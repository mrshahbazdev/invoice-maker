# Client Management & CRM: In-Depth Guide

Efficiently managing your customer relationships is central to running a successful service or product-based business. Keeping all your customer data organized and easily accessible in one central location ensures you never miss a beat when communicating, billing, or supporting your clientele. 

The **Clients** module acts as your entire Customer Relationship Management (CRM) hub. From this single dashboard, you can view the entire lifetime history of any individual or business you interact with.

## 1. Creating and Managing Client Profiles
Every interaction begins with a client profile. This is the master record where all critical information regarding a customer is stored. Having complete profiles enables you to invoice them with a single click in the future.

### Essential Business Information
When creating a new client, you can input:
- **Contact Details:** Their primary email address and direct phone number. The email provided here is strictly used by our automated mailing system to send estimates, invoices, and payment receipts.
- **Physical Address:** You can store their complete billing address (Street, City, State/Province, Zip Code, and Country). This information is automatically pulled into the "Billed To" section of any invoice you generate for them.

### Tax Compliance & Legal Fields
In many jurisdictions, B2B (Business-to-Business) invoicing requires extreme legal precision.
- **Tax Number / VAT ID:** You can save a specific Tax Identification Number (TIN) or VAT ID directly to the client profile. Whenever you create an invoice for this client, their Tax ID is automatically embedded into the final PDF, ensuring your business stays compliant with local and international tax codes without manual data entry.

## 2. The Interactive Client Dashboard
Clicking on any client's name from the main list opens their dedicated, 360-degree interactive dashboard. This screen provides you with immediate, actionable intelligence regarding your financial relationship with them.

### Lifetime Value Metrics
At the very top of the dashboard, you will instantly see:
- **Total Invoiced:** The aggregate total of every invoice ever sent to this client.
- **Total Paid (Lifetime Value):** The actual realized revenue you have collected from them.
- **Outstanding Balance:** The exact amount of money they currently owe you across all open invoices. This helps you immediately recognize if a client is in good standing before accepting new work from them.

### Document History
Below the financial metrics, you have instant access to their entire paper trail. 
- You do not need to hunt through your global list of invoices. This dashboard filters everything to show only the Invoices and Estimates specific to this one client.
- You can see which invoices are Drafted, Sent, Partial, or Paid in Full.
- You can also view all Estimates sent to them, tracking which ones were Accepted or Rejected.

## 3. Customizing Communication Channels
Every business operates differently. Some clients prefer formal, highly structured language, while others respond better to light, friendly check-ins. You shouldn't have to rewrite your emails every time you bill a different person.

### Client-Specific Email Templates
By default, your application utilizes the Global Email Templates (configured in your Business Settings) when dispatching documents. However, the Client Management system allows you to override this on a per-client basis.
- Navigate to the **Email Templates** sub-tab inside a specific client's profile.
- You can write a completely custom Subject Line and Email Body specifically tailored for them.
- Whenever you generate a new Invoice or Estimate for this client and click "Send via Email," the system will completely ignore your general settings and exclusively use their personalized template. 
- This allows you to maintain a highly personalized touch seamlessly at scale!

## 4. The Secure, Interactive Client Portal
Instead of sending your clients static, boring PDF attachments that get lost in their inbox, your subscription includes a premium, interactive web application just for your customers.

### Passwordless "Magic Link" Authentication
Your clients do not need to create an account, remember another password, or verify an email to see their bills. 
- When you send an invoice via email, it includes a robust, cryptographically secure "Magic Link."
- Clicking this link instantly authenticates them and logs them into their private Client Portal directly.

### The Statement View & Bulk Actions
Once inside the portal, your client isn't just looking at a single invoice; they are looking at their entire relationship with you.
- **Statement Summary:** They are greeted with a beautiful summary showing their total amount outstanding.
- **Online Payments:** The portal directly integrates with Stripe. A client can view an outstanding invoice and click "Pay Now" to settle their balance instantly using a credit card. The system automatically marks your internal invoice as "Paid" the millisecond the transaction clears.
- **Bulk Downloading:** For their own accounting purposes, clients often request copies of all their past bills. Instead of emailing them individually, your client can log into the portal, check the boxes next to a dozen past invoices, and click "Download Selected." The system will generate a neat ZIP file containing all their PDFs simultaneously.

### Integrated Support Ticketing
Stop losing support requests in messy email threads.
- Inside the Client Portal, your customer can click "Open New Ticket" to ask a question (e.g., "Can you update my billing address?" or "I have a question about line item #3 on my recent bill").
- This ticket appears instantly in your administrative dashboard. 
- You can reply directly from your interface. The client will receive an email notification and can respond directly back into the portal, ensuring the entire conversation remains threaded and permanently linked to their CRM profile.
