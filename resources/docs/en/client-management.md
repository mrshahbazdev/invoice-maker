# Client Management & CRM

Keep all your customer data organized and accessible in one place using the **Clients** tab.

## Adding and Managing Clients
Create detailed profiles for every person or business you bill.
- Store essential billing addresses.
- Input specific VAT numbers or Tax IDs required for legal compliance on invoices.
- Maintain primary contact emails and phone numbers.

## Client Dashboard
Clicking on a client reveals their dedicated dashboard.
- View a complete history of all Invoices and Estimates sent specifically to them.
- Immediately see their total lifetime value (total amount paid over time) and their current outstanding balance.
- Access their specific Support Tickets.

## Custom Email Templates per Client
Some clients require different communication styles.
- You can override the default email subjects and body templates on a per-client basis.
- When sending an invoice to this client, the system will automatically utilize their specific template, maintaining a personalized touch at scale.

## The Client Portal
Every client you create automatically receives a secure, private Client Portal.
- They do not need a password. You can send them a secure "Magic Link" via email.
- Inside the portal, clients can view their complete statement, download old invoices in bulk, and pay outstanding balances.
- They can also open Support Tickets directly with you regarding any billing questions.
