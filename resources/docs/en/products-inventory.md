# Products, Services & Inventory

Speed up your invoicing process by managing the items you frequently bill for in the **Products** tab.

## Creating Standard Items
Instead of typing out descriptions and prices every time you create an invoice, you can pre-save your offerings.
- **Name & Description:** Define clearly what the item is.
- **Unit Price:** Set the default cost.
- **Default Taxes:** Assign default VAT or Sales Tax rates so you never forget to apply them.
- **Category:** Organize items into "Services", "Physical Goods", or "Software".

## Automated Stock Management 
If your business sells physical goods, the platform handles basic inventory routing for you.
- When creating a product, toggle **"Manage Stock"** to ON and input your current quantity on hand.
- **Auto-Deduction:** Whenever you finalize and send an Invoice containing that product, the system automatically deducts the billed quantity from your available stock.
- This ensures you never oversell an item and always know exactly what is sitting in your warehouse or store.

## Rapid Invoicing Integration
When building a new Invoice or Estimate, simply click the "Add Product" dropdown. Selecting a saved product instantly populates the line item row with the exact description, price, and tax logic, allowing you to generate massive invoices in mere seconds.
