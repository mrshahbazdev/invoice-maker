# Custom Invoice Templates

Set your brand apart by designing unique invoice layouts that look exactly how you want.

## The Template Builder
Navigate to the **Templates** tab to access the visual drag-and-drop Template Builder. This provides a complete WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) experience for assembling your documents.

## Pre-Built Layout Styles
Switch seamlessly between multiple underlying document structures:
- **Standard Template:** The classic, proven layout optimized for standard business operations.
- **Minimalist Template:** A clean, stripped-down layout focusing heavily on typography and empty space.
- **Modern Dynamic Layout:** A colorful, boxed structure that dynamically highlights key totals and payment terms based on your primary Brand Color.

## Creating Your Palette
Inside the Template Builder, you don't just pick a layout. You can also override your default business colors for specific templates.
- Define a primary accent color specifically for this layout.
- Adjust font families (from Serif to Sans-Serif).
- Save your finished layout with a specific name (e.g., "Holiday Sales Invoice").

## Applying Templates to Invoices
When you create a new Invoice, you have total control over the design.
- By default, the system will apply your newest Template layout.
- However, during the creation phase, you can open the **Template** dropdown and select any of your saved layouts. This allows you to utilize vastly different designs for different clients, product lines, or seasons without changing your master global settings.
