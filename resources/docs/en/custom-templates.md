# Master Template Designer: A Complete Guide

Setting your brand apart technically and visually is vital when sending high-value invoices. The **Templates** module empowers you to dynamically customize the structural layout, color palette, and typography of your documents via a robust Drag-and-Drop builder instead of relying on a single, boring default structure.

## 1. Accessing the Global Builder
Navigate to the **Templates** tab in your dashboard's main navigation menu. Consider this area your visual laboratory. 

Here, you can build multiple different layouts for multiple different occasions (e.g., a formal black-and-white invoice for corporate clients, and a vibrant, colorful invoice for creative projects).

## 2. Choosing an Underlying Structure
Before customizing colors, you must select the structural wireframe of the document. We provide a suite of highly-optimized layouts:

- **The Standard Professional Layout:** The classic, proven structure designed for Maximum Legibility. It features your logo prominently at the top left, with clear, boxed data grids separating Metadata from Line Items. Ideal for large-scale enterprise billing.
- **The Minimalist Design:** A drastically stripped-down layout focusing heavily on typography and negative (white) space. It removes harsh borders and tables in favor of flowing, organic text structures. Ideal for design agencies or creative freelancers.
- **The Modern Dynamic Theme:** A heavily colorized layout that injects your primary brand color deeply into headers, footers, and total-calculation blocks. The most visually striking of the options, it guarantees your invoice will not be ignored.

## 3. Granular Design Customization
Once you have selected a structural skeleton, you can start applying your global brand identity dynamically.

### Color Palette Manipulation
Most invoicing software allows you to upload a logo and nothing else. We give you control over the actual hexadecimal (#HEX) color logic of the document.
- **Primary Brand Color:** Select a specific accent color. This color is algorithmically applied to important visual elements such as the "Total Due" box, table headers, and primary checkout buttons within the web viewer.
- **Secondary Tone:** Depending on the layout, secondary elements will inherit slight variations of your primary color to create depth automatically.

### Typography and Font Selecting
The font you use says as much about your brand as the words themselves.
- The Template Builder allows you to switch between massive typography families, including classic formal **Serif** fonts (for lawyers or financial firms), modern clean **Sans-Serif** fonts (for tech and software businesses), or **Monospaced** fonts (for developers and creative coders).
- The entire document instantly updates to reflect your typographical choice without requiring you to manually scale font sizes.

## 4. Applying Templates in Real-Time
The magic of the Template Builder is how you use the templates once they are saved.

### Per-Document Targeting
When you generate a brand new Invoice or Estimate in the Document Builder form, you are not strictly bound to your default layout.
- During the creation phase, locate the **Template** dropdown menu.
- You can dynamically select any of the customized layouts you've saved in your visual laboratory.
- This allows you to deploy completely different visual identities depending on what department you are billing for, or which subsidiary brand you are operating under for that specific client, all without ever leaving or altering your master business settings.
