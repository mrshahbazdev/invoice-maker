# Estimates & Quotes: Full Workflow Guide

Closing new deals often requires presenting a formal, professional proposal to a prospective client before any actual money changes hands. The **Estimates** module provides you with a beautiful, tracked quotation system that fluidly converts into active revenue.

## 1. Constructing a Professional Estimate
Navigate to the **Estimates** tab and click **Create New Estimate**. You will immediately notice that the builder looks nearly identical to the Invoice Builder. This is intentional, allowing you to master one interface to handle both workflows.

### Defining Quote Parameters
Estimates are inherently proposals, meaning their metadata serves a slightly different purpose:
- **Valid Until Date:** Unlike an invoice due date, an estimate has an expiration date. Prices fluctuate, and this field explicitly tells your client that the quoted price is only legally binding for a specific period (e.g., 14 Days).
- **Line Items & Pre-saved Products:** Just like an invoice, you can manually type out proposed services or pull directly from your Products/Inventory catalog to quickly assemble the quote.

## 2. Winning the Deal with Discounts
Estimates are sales tools. The platform gives you the ability to visually highlight savings to help push a prospect to sign.

- **Global Discounts:** At the bottom of the estimate, you can apply a flat dollar discount (e.g., "$500 New Client Discount") or a percentage cut. The system calculates the new subtotal instantly.
- **Terms and Conditions:** Use the notes section to explicitly outline what is *not* included in the scope of work, protecting you from scope creep once the project begins.

## 3. Delivery and Client Presentation
When you send an Estimate, the presentation is paramount.

- **Email Dispatch:** The system uses your customized Estimate Email Templates to deliver the document directly to the lead along with a generated PDF.
- **Dynamic Web View:** The email contains a secure link that opens the Estimate inside their web browser. This dynamic view looks incredible on mobile devices, ensuring your client can review and approve a $10,000 project while sitting on a train.

## 4. The One-Click Conversion Engine
This is the most powerful feature of the quotation workflow. When a client emails you back saying "Let's do it," your administrative work is essentially zero.

### Converting to an Invoice
- Open the accepted Estimate in your dashboard.
- Click the **"Convert to Invoice"** button located at the top of the screen.
- The system will instantaneously generate a brand new, live Invoice. 
- **100% Data mirroring:** Every single line item, description, tax rate, and applied discount is perfectly copied over. 
- The system automatically updates the status of the old Estimate to "Converted" so you know the deal was won, and drops you directly into the new Invoice, ready to be sent for initial payment collection immediately!
