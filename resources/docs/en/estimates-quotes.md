# Estimates & Quotes

Secure new business deals by sending professional proposals before finalizing a sale.

## Creating an Estimate
Navigate to the **Estimates** tab to begin. The flow is nearly identical to creating a standard invoice, ensuring a smooth and familiar experience.
- Add your client and line items.
- Apply potential discounts to win the deal.
- Include specific terms and conditions regarding the quote's validity timeframe.

## Sending and Presentation
Just like Invoices, Estimates generate beautiful PDF documents and secure public web links.
- Send the Estimate via our automated email launcher.
- The client receives a link where they can view the breakdown of costs dynamically on any device.

## One-Click Conversion to Invoice
The most powerful feature of the Estimates system is the conversion flow.
- Once a client reviews the quote and gives you the green light to proceed, you don't need to rebuild the document.
- Simply click the **"Convert to Invoice"** button on the Estimate dashboard.
- The system instantly generates a live, active Invoice mirroring every detail of the quote. The new invoice is immediately ready to be sent for payment collection!
