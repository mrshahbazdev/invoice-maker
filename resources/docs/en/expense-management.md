# Expense Tracking & Management: Detailed Guide

A profitable business isn't just about how much revenue you bring in; it’s about carefully monitoring how much money goes out. The **Expenses** module acts as your digital filing cabinet, ensuring you never lose a receipt and you always know exactly where your operating capital is being spent.

## 1. Logging a New Expense
Whenever you purchase software, equipment, or travel for business, you should log it immediately. Navigate to the **Expenses** tab and click **Log Expense**.

### Categorization and Organization
Proper categorization is the key to actionable financial data at the end of the year.
- **Expense Category:** Select what type of expense this was (e.g., "Software Subscription", "Office Supplies", "Travel", "Meals & Entertainment"). This categorizes the outflow so your Cash Book can generate accurate pie charts of your spending habits.
- **Amount & Date:** Log the exact amount paid and the date the transaction occurred.
- **Vendor / Merchant:** Record exactly who you paid (e.g., "Amazon", "Delta Airlines", "Microsoft"). This helps you identify recurring costs over time.

## 2. Receipt and Document Storage
If you get audited, a line item in a spreadsheet isn't enough; you need the actual receipt. The platform provides secure, cloud-based document attachment.

- **Upload Field:** When logging an expense, you can click "Attach File" and upload the PDF receipt, the JPEG photo of the restaurant bill, or a screenshot of the digital transaction.
- **Permanent Storage:** This file is securely encrypted and attached permanently to the expense record in the cloud. You can literally throw away your physical shoebox full of receipts—your entire audit trail is digitized and searchable.

## 3. Billable Expenses (Client Re-Billing)
Often, you incur costs on behalf of a specific client that they are contractually obligated to reimburse you for (e.g., server hosting fees, stock photography purchases, or travel tickets).

### The Re-Billing Workflow
The platform handles this complex accounting maneuver flawlessly:
1. When logging the expense (e.g., a $50 Stock Photo), look for the **"Assign to Client"** dropdown.
2. Select the specific client this was purchased for.
3. Check the box labeled **"Billable"**.
4. The system flags this expense internally. 
5. The very next time you create a new Invoice for that specific client, the system will alert you that you have unbilled expenses for them. With one click, you can inject that $50 Stock Photo cost directly onto the invoice as a line item, ensuring you never forget to get reimbursed for out-of-pocket costs.

## 4. Global Financial Integration
The Expenses module does not exist in a vacuum. It is deeply hardwired into the **Cash Book** and accounting core.

- Every single expense you log instantly deducts from your Net Profit metric in the main dashboard.
- If you miscategorize an expense, you can edit it at any time, and the Cash Book math will recalculate your P&L (Profit and Loss) statements in real-time across the entire platform.
