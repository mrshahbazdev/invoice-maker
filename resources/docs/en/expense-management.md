# Expense Management

Track where your money is going with our intuitive Expense Management tracking.

## Creating Expenses
Log purchases easily in the **Expenses** tab.
- Select tracking categories (e.g., IT, Marketing, Office Supplies).
- Input custom expense numbers to match your internal referencing, or use the auto-generated ones.
- **Direct Attribution:** Link an expense directly to a specific Invoice (e.g., shipping costs for a specific order) to track exact profitability.

## Receipt Attachments & Previews
Upload multiple PDF receipts, JPEGs, or PNG images to justify the expense. Our built-in document preview allows you to view the receipts directly in the app without having to download them first.

## AI Receipt Scanning
Save time with AI! Upload a receipt image, and click "Scan Receipt". The Artificial Intelligence engine will automatically read the receipt and extract the Merchant Name, Total Amount, Date, and Category, filling out the creation form for you instantly.

## Automated B2B Network Sync
This represents an advanced SaaS "Network Effect".
If you do business with a supplier who also uses our platform, and you have toggled **Accept Network Invoices** to "On" in your Business Profile, any invoice they send you will be immediately and securely injected into your Expenses dashboard! No manual entry required.
